Originally, I had planned to make a video game for my ICS3U1 culminating, however that turned out to be a flop (more on that [here](https://github.com/yak-fumblepack/InHighSchool)). 

So instead, I made a webapp centered around the workflow that I normally use and how I could make it much more efficient. This is still a crude implementation and far from a production ready product, but I think it demonstrates the main ideas behind it well.
